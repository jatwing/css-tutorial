          One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers
          sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
          watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide
          chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were
          papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds
          and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
          millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
          without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
